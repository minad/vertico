#+language: en

* Version 2.7 (2026-01-18)

- =vertico-multiform-mode=: Check state of modes during minibuffer setup.
- =vertico-next-group=, =vertico-previous-group=: Simplify group handling.

* Version 2.6 (2025-11-15)

- Require Emacs 29.1.
- =vertico-buffer=: Check if =mode-line-format= is =nil= when computing an appropriate
  =vertico-count= for the window height.

* Version 2.5 (2025-09-08)

- Introduce new =vertico--locals= variable for easier customization of
  minibuffer-local variables.
- =vertico-mouse=, =vertico-group-format=: Try to avoid overly long candidates such
  that no truncation markers are shown if the fringe is disabled.
- Undo fringe settings introduced in version 2.3. Users can customize this
  according to their preference in =vertico--locals=.
- Revert to =vertico--resize-window= again (from Vertico 1.9), which takes a
  minibuffer height argument. Minibuffer resizing is still not correct on Emacs
  31 if fringes are disabled, i.e., =(set-fringe-mode 0)=.

- New function =vertico-sort-directories-first= which sorts a list of file names,
  with directories coming first.

  category. Either specify a list of key bindings or a keymap directly.
- Disable =completion-eager-display= if Vertico is active.

* Version 2.3 (2025-06-10)

- =vertico-multiform-mode=: Add context menu to change display mode. First enable

  right click in the Vertico minibuffer.
- Hide fringe line truncation indicators in the minibuffer.

  =savehist-minibuffer-history-variables= in order to save the history if
  =savehist-mode= is enabled.

  history.
