;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a Vertico extension providing the `vertico-suspend'
;; command to suspend the current Vertico completion session.  If
;; `vertico-suspend' is called from within the currently active
;; Vertico minibuffer, the completion session is suspended.  Otherwise
;; the last session is restored.  It is possible to suspend multiple
;; nested Vertico sessions.  Note that `vertico-suspend' requires that
;; recursive minibuffers are enabled by setting the customizable
;; variable `enable-recursive-minibuffers' to t.
;;
;; (keymap-global-set "M-S" #'vertico-suspend)
;;
;; See also the related extension `vertico-repeat', which uses a
;; different technique, storing a completion session history.
;;
;; There exists a small issue with `vertico-suspend'.  The setting
;; `echo-keystrokes' does not work.  Unfortunately this cannot be
;; fixed without modifying the C source of Emacs, since Emacs forcibly
;; disables echo if a minibuffer is active.
